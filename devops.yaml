  - title: Dockerize Learning Management System (LMS) 
    description: This project focuses on containerising and deploying a Learning Management System (LMS) on AWS using Docker. A Dockerfile is created to define the backend application's dependencies and runtime settings. Similarly, for the LMS frontend a dedicated Dockerfile is crafted to specify the environment for the React.js frontend application. A PostgreSQL container is created to run the database as a separate entity.
